                Nature’s Heart Foundation Action for Development and Empowerment
                Initiatives has generated measurable impact through the design
                and implementation of GreenGlowUp Africa, a youth-led climate
                education and resilience initiative embedded within public
                secondary schools in Northern Nigeria. The organization’s impact
                lies in demonstrating how climate education, youth leadership,
                and policy literacy can be integrated into formal education
                systems that traditionally marginalize climate learning and
                youth voice. During the pilot (mini) phase, GreenGlowUp Africa
                was implemented across seven public secondary schools in Kaduna
                State, spanning a mixed geographic context, with four urban and
                three peri-urban/rural schools.<span class="more-text">
                  The initiative reached over 1,000 students and 100 teachers,
                  engaging them through participatory climate learning sessions,
                  hands-on environmental action, and school-based dialogue. A
                  pre- and post-intervention survey, complemented by focus group
                  discussions among members of the Students Green Climate Clubs,
                  showed a 64 percent increase in awareness and understanding of
                  climate actions, climate-resilient practices, and Nigeria’s
                  national climate policies among participating students and
                  teachers. Gender inclusion was central to implementation, with
                  60 percent female representation among student club members
                  and gender parity among participating teachers. Sustainability
                  was embedded through the establishment of Students Green
                  Climate Clubs in all seven schools, all of which remain active
                  beyond the pilot phase. Environmental action outcomes included
                  the planting of 122 nursery trees, with 73 trees surviving and
                  continuing to grow, now providing shade, fruit, and ecological
                  benefits within school environments. At the institutional
                  level, the organization strengthened its policy capacity
                  through support from the Nigeria Youth SDGs Network, German
                  Missions, and the Yandytech Community. Training on Nigeria’s
                  National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and Nationally Determined
                  Contributions (NDCs) enabled the organization to localize
                  national climate priorities and align school-level climate
                  education with broader adaptation frameworks. Overall,
                  GreenGlowUp Africa demonstrates a scalable, school-centered
                  model that embeds climate education, sustains youth
                  leadership, and links learning to practical environmental and
                  policy-relevant outcomes.

                  <b>Intro:</b> Green Glow Up Africa inspires students to take
                  action against climate change. Through workshops, tree
                  planting, and community advocacy, participants gain knowledge
                  and practical experience in environmental sustainability.
                  Students become eco-leaders, developing teamwork, leadership,
                  and civic responsibility while positively impacting their
                  communities. Each tree planted symbolizes hope, growth, and a
                  commitment to protecting the planet.
